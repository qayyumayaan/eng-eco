# Retirement Income Calculator 
I adapted the formulas from my Engineering Economics course from Rutgers University (14:540:343) from Fall 2022. Not only can this website help you calculate your retirement, it can also help you pass this class. 
All content was adapted from the Rutgers course. Specific formulas can be found on this formula sheet: https://staff.emu.edu.tr/gokhanizbirak/Documents/courses/ieng323-mane323/assignments-homeworks/Formulas-Engineering-Economy.pdf.
